			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Women's equality has been given great importance in modern society, including education, work and
				economic opportunities. Females' thoughts and lives have changed. This is especially so for female
				millennials. Female millennials are redefining the meaning of gender.
			</p>
			<p>
				They are more conscious of having an equal opportunity to create a successful life, and believe that
				gender no longer restricts their lives or behaviors. They would rather not comply with traditional
				Taiwanese rules and gender roles. The life choices they make are their own - no one can judge them, tell
				them who they are, or what they should be.
			</p>
			<p>
				Knowing that ambitious millennials are different from previous generations, this research's aim is to
				find out how they consider marriage, which is the most important phase of life for traditional Taiwanese
				women.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through a questionnaire, analyzing interview responses and information visualization, I tried to compare
				the core distinction between millennials and the older generation to identify the thoughts and attitudes
				young Taiwanese females have towards marriage.

				<h2>Unmarried Status Has Become a Fact for Young Taiwanese Female Millennials</h2>
				<p>
					Taiwanese millennials are approaching marriage differently than their parents and grandparents.
					They prefer to wait longer in order to find the right partner.
				</p>

					<div class="marriage-chart-title">Female unmarried ratios by age in Taiwan</div>
					<div class="marriage-chart-legend" id="chart-one">
						<span class="pattern young"></span>
						<span>2019</span>

				<p>
					According to data released by the Gender Equality Committee, Executive Yuan, women aged between 25
					and 34, on average, walk down the aisle six years later than those in the previous generation.
					Nearly eight in ten modern young females are single, which is a far higher number than ten years
					ago.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, young women in Taiwan have a low willingness to get married. We conducted a
					questionnaire which was given randomly to Taiwanese females 25 to 34 years old in an effort to
					survey the extent of willingness to get married.
				</p>
				<div class="marriage-chart-metadata">
					<div class="marriage-chart-title">Female Millennials Say No to Marriage</div>
				</div>
				<div class="marriage-chart-area" id="unmarried-ratio">
				</div>
				<p>
					It is noteworthy that almost 14% of respondents' answers were "0", indicating that there are plenty
					of women who don't want to get married at all. Also, over half of the respondents gave an answer
					below the midpoint.
				</p>
				<p>
					These data indicate that remaining unmarried or getting married later in life has become a trend in
					Taiwan. Young women no longer consider marriage an urgent issue, and they even feel pessimistic
					about building a married life.
				</p>
				<h2>Young Aged Women in Taiwan Think Marriage Is No Longer Essential</h2>
				<p>
					For women over 35 years old, a certain proportion of respondents see marriage as a crucial process
					in life. Additionally, a quarter of female respondents aged over 35 consider marriage a requirement
					in order for them to have children.
				</p>
				<p>
					We found that marriage is of great importance to these older women. Marriage is a status symbol
					which means that you are at “the next level”, and you have “admission tickets” to have children and
					a happy family.
				</p>

					<div class="marriage-chart-title">Proportions of the meanings of marriage by respondents</div>
					<div class="marriage-chart-legend" id="chart-one">
						<span class="pattern young"></span>
						<span>25-34</span>
						<span class="pattern old"></span>
						<span>45-54</span>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="marriage-chart-area" id="marriage-meanings"></div>
				<p>
					In contrast, female millennials don’t completely agree that marriage is an indispensable part of
					life. Up to 13% of respondents in the 25 to 34 age group don't think marriage is significant at all.
				</p>
				<p>
					For these young women, companionship is more meaningful than marriage itself. They would like
					someone to
					be on their side when they are facing challenges or accompany them in old age, and this person
					doesn't
					need to be a husband – their companion could be a soulmate, boyfriend or girlfriend.
				</p>
				<h2>Happiness with One’s Own Life Has Replaced Marriage as the Most Important Consideration for
					Taiwanese Female Millennials
				</h2>
				<p>Marriage is losing its importance. Traditional concepts do not limit female millennials, to some
					degree. Among 43% of female respondents who consider being a good wife as one of the most important
					factors for a successful life, only 21% are millennials.
				</p>
				<p>By contrast, they dedicate themselves to living a happy life. 65% of female respondents choose to
					master their own life as the definition of life success, and 51% of them are women in the 25 to 35
					age group.
				</p>
				<p>
					This does not mean that modern women despise family values. There are still many young aged women
					who long for family lives. However, they are tired of being stuck in the traditional wife’s role and
					cannot be themselves.
				</p>
				<p>
					Moreover, marriage in Taiwan is not only about the wife and husband, as both partners’ families are
					also involved. This creates complex issues for women to handle, so they would rather not get married
					to keep their lives be more flexible and independent.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore, we can conclude that young women don’t feel optimistic when it comes to marriage. They
					are worried that getting married will bring negative changes to their lives.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Worries and Expectations Relating to Marriage from Female Millennials Are Changing Simultaneously
				</h2>
				<div class="marriage-chart-metadata">
					<div class="marriage-chart-title">Proportions of thoughts of marriage selected by respondents</div>
					<div class="marriage-chart-legend" id="chart-one">
						<span class="pattern young"></span>
						<span>25-34</span>
						<span class="pattern old"></span>
						<span>45-54</span>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="marriage-chart-area" id="marriage-thoughts">
					<select id="marriageThoughtsButton"></select>
				</div>
				<p>
					Research has found that female millennials' main apprehension derives from a long-standing character
					requirement, which is that women should integrate into the family-in-law. In the traditional
					Taiwanese mind-set, the wife has the responsibility to remain on good terms with the husband's
					family. For example, a wife should show Chinese parental respect to her mother-in-law, making her
					husband comfortable at home is her goal, and educating her children well is also an important
					standard for being “a good wife”.
				</p>
				<p>
					These factors have become a heavy burden for women to carry. Nowadays, as marriage becomes an option
					and life management is highly regarded, young females are starting to consider whether marriage
					would harm their life plans or career.
				</p>
				<p>
					In contrast to traditional “good wives”, young females prefer to use communication to solve family
					problems. There is no “must”, and every household task can be negotiated. This includes raising
					children; they think that males also have the responsibility to take care of their kids. This is not
					just a woman's job.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore, female millennials expect to maintain healthy relationships with their partners instead
					of bearing compelling family issues. If there is no talking, they would rather not get married and
					enjoy managing their free, single lives instead. Communication is the thing that young aged women
					value and pursue the most.
				</p>
				<h2>Marriage and Women's Lives Are Rewritten</h2>
				<p>
					Female millennials are conscious of gender inequality in the family system. To fight these
					traditional Taiwanese concepts, they show a firm attitude towards marriage. Marriage is not a “must”
					anymore. It is just one of the millions of multiple options in life.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to being wives, modern women play many social roles, and there is more freedom for them
					to choose the way they want to be in every sphere. They can pursue their achievements, decide
					whether they would like to make sacrifices for family, and most importantly, to live the ideal lives
					they dream of.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the past, women made a compromise with family, society and paternalism. Now, what they want to do
					is break the constraints and make themselves happy.
