            <p>Millennials, also known as “generation rent”, are now under great pressure in Taiwan due to housing
                problems. To deal with this challenge, in the spirit of the sharing economy, co-living has become one of
                the great solutions, as it not only makes housing more affordable but also creates a flexible,
                sustainable lifestyle for residents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Involving cooperation with the 9floor co-living brand, this project aims to provide insights into the
                Taipei shared living scenario based on interviews and data analysis. The research focuses on three
                factors – participants’ life goals at the present stage, the living space layout they prefer, and their
                social connections with people and the community. All three factors significantly affect the motivation
                for living in shared housing.
            </p>
            <p>
                This research is an exploration of the unique world of shared living in Taipei, featuring an analysis of
                the trend behind co-living, in the hope of serving as a gateway for people who dream of an innovative
                way of living in the future.
            </p>
            <h2>Lack of Affordable Studio Apartments for Rent</h2>
            <p>
                In Taipei, the average rental price of studio apartments is NT$14,860 a month, which accounts for nearly
                50% of millennials’ average income per month. In addition, young adults’ incomes have remained stagnant.
            </p>
            <p>
                The growth rate of the average young adult salary was only 22% from 2009 to 2019. The widening gap
                between house prices and income levels means that millennials in Taipei have to deal with a lot of
                pressure as a result of housing problems.
            </p>
            <h2>Sharing May Be the Answer?</h2>
            <p>
                To address the problem of low housing quality, sharing a family-style apartment has become a popular
                option.
            </p>
            <p>
                Featuring comfortable living rooms, well-equipped kitchens, spacious balconies, and most importantly,
                less economic burden at a reasonable price, family-style apartments can provide better living conditions
                than single suites. This helps millennials to find an ideal way to live through tough times.
            </p>
            <h2>Family Style Apatments Are Way More Economical</h2>
            <h2>Co-living: The Sharing Solution to Housing Problems</h2>
            <p>In the spirit of the sharing economy, co-living breaks traditional possession forms, which has generated
                heated discussion. By creating a unique living experience, co-living involves enhancing the basic
                family-style apartment with upgraded services and amenities. Furthermore, co-living platforms are
                committed to creating a sense of community and practicing a socially fulfilling lifestyle. Thus, a
                co-living platform is defined as a special service rather than a product.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nowadays, freelancers, flexible workers and working nomads who often transfer locations are less bound
                to specific places or working hours. Many people’s working lives are no longer linked to a regular
                physical office, and spaces may also serve as working studios. Hence, co-living spaces have the
                potential to meet modern workers' needs. They integrate all kinds of conditions, providing a way of
                living rather than just housing, creating new possibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that the traditional housing lifestyle could be reimagined by shared living. Co-living spaces
                can be designed to give consideration to people's privacy, while also providing shared places for people
                to gather in small groups, thus outweighing the minimal single space.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Clarifying the Cluster Composition and Characteristics of Cluster Participants in Taipei Co-living
                Community
            </h2>
            <p>
                In order to ensure the interviewees’ diversity, and determine the key features of people living in the
                co-living community, we selected interviewees by classifying eight clusters according to two dimensions
                - the time they spent in the co-living space, and the extent to which they engaged in the co-living
                community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unsurprisingly, due to the Taiwanese national character, most of the residents we interviewed are shy
                and would rather be followers than leaders. However, we can see that some active leaders are making an
                effort to bind the community together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, the time residents spend in the co-living space doesn't show a negative correlation with their
                activeness in engaging in the co-living community. There are plenty of office workers who need to stay
                outside for long periods for work who still put effort into leading their housemates to create a
                splendid way of living.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides having varied personality traits, co-living residents also embrace different lifestyle focuses,
                such as professionalism, community and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Research inquired into various aspects of residents’ lives, believing that three factors have a high
                correlation with their motivation to move into a co-living space. One is their life pace, their aims at
                the present point in their lives; another is people's connections, how they interacted with others; and
                the space layout, the way they utilise the public and private living space.
            </p>

            <h2>New Possibilities for Living</h2>
            <p>
                Shared living has become a new solution for Taiwanese millennials, helping them to deal with the
                economic problems associated with housing.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, we found the high rental housing issue is not the only thing that Taipei co-living residents
                are concerned about. The connections between people which are being lost due to modern technologies is
                another problem they want to resolve. Whether they expand their social network through work or try to
                meet new friends to enrich their lives, co-living offers opportunities for them to end loneliness.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a multi-functional place, a co-living space provides residents with the flexibility to use their
                imagination. On the other hand, residents' interactions and lifestyles create more possibilities for
                these spaces. Though Taipei is a narrow place to live in, many residents are finding a practical,
                creative way to manage their lives through co-living.
